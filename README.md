# blockchain-vote
Simple blockchain voting application.  This is a sample project for learning to program a distributed blockchain application.  The concept is that users propose projects in their community then solicit votes to see which projects are most desireable.  In a full application, one could imagine that community memebers might actually fund projects for their communities.

# Community Project Examples
* Fixing up parks
* Converting a stop sign to a stop light
* Putting in a speedbump or slow sign
* Resurface roadways
* Adding bike lanes or walking paths

# Running

1. To run clone the project into a local directory
2. Navigate to the directory and from terminal call `npm install`
3. Run `node website.js` to start on localhost:3000
